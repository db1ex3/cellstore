        <h1 class="text-center">Welcome,<br /> IBM. <br /><br /> Seriously.</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the most exciting and important marketplace since relational databases began 44 years ago.</p>
        <p>And congratulations on <a href="http://xbrl.mybluemix.net">xbrl.mybluemix.net</a>, your first XBRL repository.</p>
        <p>Putting the data back into the hands of business users will improve the way companies work, get insight on their internal processes, learn from this, improve and spend more time with their customers.</p>
        <p>Exabytes of data are produced every day, and it is becoming increasingly challenging to extract information from them. Yet, it is a great opportunity to get information and insight on unprecedented scales -- perhaps this is what drives the BigData trend.</p>
        <p>When we started <a href="http://secxbrl.info">secxbrl.info</a> last year, we estimated that over 140,000,000 companies worldwide could justify the migration to a business reporting standard, if only they understood its benefits. More and more regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, are coming to this understanding and already ask companies to report using XBRL.</p>
        <p>Over the next decade, we expect spreadsheets and databases to integrate more and more seamlessly, and we expect that the NoSQL paradigms will be leveraged transparently behind the hood, while business users focus on their taxonomies and data. As you will probably discover when you try to deal with the tens of thousands of dimensions contained in SEC filings, this is not a trivial task, and <a href="http://28.io/nolap">you have to go beyond OLAP</a>.</p>
        <p>We look forward to this competition in the effort to distribute this database technology to the world. And we appreciate your commitment. Because what we are doing is increasing transparency by enhancing business productivity.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the task. <a href="http://28.io">28msec</a>.</p>
