                <p>Compare or aggregate facts across filings, entities, periods, or sectors. Filter by any combination of explicit dimensions. Easily deal with amendments or duplicated information. Apply custom mappings of synonymous concepts. Use business rules to compute unreported facts or key ratios.</p>
