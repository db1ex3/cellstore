				<h4>Governing Law and Arbitration</h4>
				<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
					<li><b>Governing Law</b>.  You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over 28msec, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.  This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.  The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16).  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.</li>
					<li><b>Arbitration</b>.  READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM 28MSEC.
					<p>In the unlikely event that 28msec has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any 28msec claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms of Service, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services ("JAMS") under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein.  The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and 28msec agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing 28msec from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of 28msec's proprietary interests.</p>
					<p>ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND 28MSEC ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, .COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</p></li>

					<li><b>Assignment</b>.  This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by 28msec without restriction.  Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</li>
					<li><b>Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement</b>.  28msec may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by 28msec in our sole discretion.  28msec reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement.  28msec is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.  28msec may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically.  When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the 'last modified' date at the bottom of this page.  Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.  If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.</li>
					<li><b>Entire Agreement/Severability</b>.  This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with 28msec in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and 28msec concerning the Service.  If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</li>
					<li><b>No Waiver</b>.  No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and 28msec's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li>
					<li><b>Government Use Rights</b>.  If the Service is licensed to the United States government or any agency thereof, then the Service will be deemed to be "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable.  Any use, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the Service and any accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by these Terms of Service and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by these Terms of Service.</li>
